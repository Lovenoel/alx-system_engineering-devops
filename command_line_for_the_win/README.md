# command_line_for_the_win

How I used the sftp command-line tool
- I firstly used sftp username@remote_host.
-It prompted for my remote password which I put in.
-Which brought the sftp prompt. Which I used as below.
-I used cd alx-system_engineering-devops
-Then cd command_line_for_the_win
- Then I went to my local machine still in sftp, I used cd upto the directory that had my files but which this one I used lcd; l standing for local machine
-Then when I reached my files' directory I used the put command for all the files, i.e put 0-first_9_tasks.jpg and I did that for all the files.
This put all my files in the rightful directory for then in the remote server.
-Thankyou for reviewing my work, God bless much for me...
