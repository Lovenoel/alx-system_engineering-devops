Postmortem: Service Outage on June 10, 2024

Issue Summary

Duration:
June 10, 2024, 14:00 - June 10, 2024, 17:00 (UTC)

Impact:
Our primary e-commerce platform was down for three hours, affecting approximately 80% of users. Customers experienced issues logging in, adding items to their carts, and completing purchases.

Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfigured database failover setting during a routine update, which led to a database server overload.

Timeline
14:00 UTC: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating high database response times.
14:05 UTC: Engineering team begins investigation into database performance.
14:15 UTC: Initial hypothesis suggests a spike in traffic is causing slowdowns.
14:30 UTC: Database admin team investigates server logs; no unusual traffic patterns found.
15:00 UTC: Incident escalated to the DevOps team after further degradation in service.
15:15 UTC: Misleading path: Investigated potential DDoS attack; no evidence found.
15:45 UTC: Root cause identified as misconfigured failover settings in the database cluster.
16:00 UTC: Configuration corrected and database servers restarted.
16:30 UTC: Services begin to stabilize; ongoing monitoring for any further issues.
17:00 UTC: Full service restored and confirmed operational.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
During a routine update to improve database performance, the failover settings for the database cluster were misconfigured. This misconfiguration caused the primary database server to become overloaded when it failed to properly distribute the load to secondary servers. As a result, the database performance deteriorated rapidly, affecting the entire e-commerce platform.

Resolution:
The database configuration was reviewed, and the failover settings were corrected to ensure proper load distribution. The database servers were then restarted to apply the new settings. Once the servers were back online, performance returned to normal levels, and the e-commerce platform was fully operational.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

 - Database Configuration Review: Implement a thorough review process for any configuration changes to critical systems.
 - Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring to detect configuration issues more quickly and accurately.
 - Failover Testing: Regularly test failover procedures to ensure they function correctly under various scenarios.
 - Documentation: Update and expand documentation on database configuration and failover processes.

Tasks:

 - Patch Database Servers: Apply patches to address any underlying software issues contributing to the outage.
 - Add Monitoring Alerts: Implement additional monitoring alerts specifically for configuration anomalies.
 - Conduct Failover Drills: Schedule regular failover drills to test and validate failover configurations.
 - Update Documentation: Enhance documentation with detailed steps on configuring and validating database failover settings.
 Team Training: Conduct training sessions for the engineering and DevOps teams on proper configuration management practices.

 By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve the overall reliability and stability of our services.
